# ICS4U_Algorithms
ICS4U Unit on Algorithms

This is where I will keep track of my ability to solve a 2x2x2

Day 1:
1. What did I learn about Algorithms today?
- I familiaerized myself with different Algorithms using https://www.youcandothecube.com/solve-it/2-x-2-solution

2. How do I know it was algorithmic?
- I was following a process of rules to solve a problem/puzzle

3. What is an algorithm to you?
- A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations
